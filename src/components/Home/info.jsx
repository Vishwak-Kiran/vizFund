            Globally, the number of people living in extreme poverty declined
            from 36 per cent in 1990 to 10 per cent in 2015. But the pace of
            change is decelerating and the COVID-19 crisis risks reversing
            decades of progress in the fight against poverty.</p><br></br><p> More than 700
            million people, or 10 per cent of the world population, still live
            in extreme poverty today, struggling to fulfil the most basic needs
            like health, education, and access to water and sanitation, to name
            a few. The majority of people living on less than $1.90 a day live
            in sub-Saharan Africa. Worldwide, the poverty rate in rural areas is
            17.2 per centâ€”more than three times higher than in urban areas.
